## Backend Structure

This document provides an explanation of the backend structure of ShieldPay.

ShieldPay/tree/main/api/v1/views/user
This path contains routes/endpoints for handling Registration, Login, User Profile, and Logout.

ShieldPay/tree/main/api/v1/views/transactions
This path contains routes/endpoints for handling transactions.

### User_Views

@app_views.route('/register', methods=\['POST'\])

User Registration: Checks if the user with the provided email already exists. Returns a 409 error if the user exists, or proceeds to create a new user if not.

Account Creation: Calls account_service.create_account() to initialize an account for the user with zero funds and sets user_id.

Response: Returns a JSON response with a 201 status code, including user details and account information.

@app_views.route('/login', methods=\['POST'\])
Function: login_user()

Data Extraction: Extracts email, phone_number, and password from the request data.

Input Validation: Checks for either email or phone_number and password. Returns a 400 error if any are missing.
